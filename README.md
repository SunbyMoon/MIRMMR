# To do
1. Compose MSImodel
  1. Write connective tissue
    1. Command line processing
    2. Data input cleaning
    2. Logic of commands
  2. Write modules
    1. Univariate analysis
    2. Stepwise model building
    3. Penalized regression
      1. Selection of lambda
      2. Comparison of train/test accuracy with final (all data) model
    4. Meta results (run time, etc.) 
    5. Compare with other methods
      1. Locate canonical tissue type bams
      2. Run existing methods
      3. ROC curves
      4. Discordant pairs
2. Compose paper
