# To do
1. Compose MSImodel
  1. ~~Write connective tissue~~
    1. ~~Command line processing~~
    2. ~~Data input cleaning~~
    3. ~~Logic of commands~~
  2. Write modules
    1. ~~Univariate analysis~~
    2. ~~Stepwise model building~~
    3. ~~Penalized regression~~
      1. ~~Selection of lambda~~
      2. ~~Comparison of train/test accuracy with final (all data) model~~
      3. ~~Plotting~~
    4. Compare with other methods
      1. Locate canonical tissue type bams
      2. Run existing methods
      3. ROC curves
      4. Discordant pairs
    5. ~~Predict~~
      1. ~~Model.Robj and data.frame input~~
